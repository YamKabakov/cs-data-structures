# CS Data Structures Library

This project implements essential data structures from scratch in Java, including:

- HashMap
- LinkedList
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Stack & Queue
- TreeMap (Balanced BST)

Each structure is built with a focus on readability, efficiency, and proper documentation. Includes unit tests for correctness and example use cases.

## Tech
- Java
- JUnit (for testing)

## Purpose
This project strengthens my understanding of how fundamental data structures work under the hood, often asked in technical interviews.
