# 🎯 MyQueue

This module provides a simple and efficient implementation of a queue using a singly linked list. The queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle and supports all standard operations.

## 🛠️ Features

- `enqueue(String value)`
    Adds a value to the end of the queue.

- `dequeue()` 
    Removes and returns the front value.

- `peek()` 
    Returns the front value without removing it.

- `isEmpty()` 
    Checks whether the queue is empty.

- `size()` 
    Returns the number of elements in the queue.

- `clear()`
    Removes all elements from the queue.

- `contains(String value)` 
    Checks if a value exists in the queue.

- `toString()` 
    Returns a string representation from front to rear.

## 📌 Notes

- This implementation is based on a singly linked list
- All operations are tested in `QueueTest.java`.
