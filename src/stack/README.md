# ðŸ“¦ MyStack

This module provides a simple and efficient implementation of a stack using a singly linked list. The stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and supports all standard operations.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- `push(String value)`
    Adds a value to the top of the stack.

- `pop()`
    Removes and returns the top value.

- `peek()`
    Returns the top value without removing it.

- `isEmpty()`
    Checks whether the stack is empty.

- `size()`
    Returns the number of elements in the stack.

- `clear()` 
    Empties the stack.

- `contains(String value)`
    Checks if a specific value exists in the stack.
    
- `toString()`
   Returns a string representation from top to bottom.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This implementation is based on a singly linked list
- All operations are tested in `StackTest.java`
